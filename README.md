# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Sql Analysis 


# Overview of the analysis:

The Management had asked Bobby and our team to dive into its 300000 plus employees and provide a detailed breakdown of potential challenges the company might face shortly.

The initial study as part of the PH_Employee DB study resulted in the knowledge that many staff will be retiring, leaving behind a considerable number of vacancies to fill in a short time.


The project is for a large company called Pewlett Hackard that employs several thousands of employees.
Employment information was analyzed to assess the number of employees that could be entering the retirement age and determine the number of potential vacancies to fill in the near future.
To prevent the high increase of retirement, Pewlett Hackard is offering a retirement package by introducing a mentoring program where experienced and successful employees will be stepping back into a part-time role instead of retiring completely.
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.
